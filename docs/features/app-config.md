# Application customization through appConfig.js

The appConfig.json file in the project's root directory allows developers to set properties which can be used to configure different values inside CUI. In addition, developers can add their own values and access those values inside of the app via the appConfig object.

To learn more about existing property options, please reference the schema file located in `app/json/jsonSchema.json`
