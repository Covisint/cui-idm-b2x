# Data Storage

The DataStorage factory gives developers a quick solution to interface with local storage to store data between different states. Stored data can be organized based on specific users.

### Object and Array Type Data

* DataStorage gives you GET/SET/DELETE/CLEAR methods to work with key/value pair data objects.

### Array Type Data Only

* There are many endpoints that return and array of objects. For this DataStorage provides methods that will delete or replace data in an array that matches a provided comparison.
