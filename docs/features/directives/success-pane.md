# Success Pane

The success pane is a re-occuring element that appears at the end of the various action flows (application request, person registration request, claim/grant updates).

The directive allows you to customize the general look of the success pane from one spot, and also allows specific customizations such as linking to custom functions or auto closing the pane after a specified amount of time.
