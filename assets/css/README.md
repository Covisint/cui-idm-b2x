# NOTE

`main.css` IS A DERIVED FILE. DO _NOT_ EDIT YOUR CSS HERE.
To edit your css go to assets -> scss and either edit 0-base -> variables.scss to overwrite / set scss variables or add new scss files to any of the other folders in that directory.

assets->main.scss will import the `dir` file from each of the scss directories, so just make sure to import your new scss file in the respective <directory>-dir.scss file.
