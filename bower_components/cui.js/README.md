Add the following script tags in your html header:

    <script src="[YOUR-PATH-TO]/jquery.min.js"></script>
    <script src="[YOUR-PATH-TO]/cui.min.js"></script>

The lodash and jquery dependencies can either be referenced via CDN, or installed locally, to suit your needs.

## Building

Download the entire project into a new directory. Then from that directory do:

    npm install
    bower install

After those commands succeed, you can build via grunt as follows:

    grunt

## Demo / Documentation

After building locally, do:

    grunt demo        

This opens the CUI Demo page in your browser, where you can then learn about and test the library.
